    "# Introduction to the Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebooks, students will receive an introduction to natural language processing, or NLP, and the Python library spaCy. SpaCy allows users to perform NLP tasks via Python. In academia, the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, has remained quite popular. SpaCy is an industry alternative to NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy using spaCy in all my NLP workflows for a few reasons. First, spaCy's syntax, or the way in which you write code to do things with the spaCy library, is fairly straightforward. Second, it allows you to construct robust pipelines for processing texts and extracting relevant information from them. Third, spaCy has powerful built-in components that allow you to use both heuristics, or rules, and machine learning. Fourth, out-of-the-box, spaCy offers pipelines and machine learning components for many modern languages. Each month their team and the community add more support for existing languages and support new languages. Fifth, training new machine learning models via spaCy is relatively simple and easy to replicate. Sixth, spaCy has a strong community and forum; if you have a question, someone is usually their to help. Seventh, spaCy scales well, meaning you can process many texts efficiently. Eighth, it is comprehensive enough to add new languages into its framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these three notebooks, students will learn the basics of spaCy and how to use it to solve a real-world problem in a digital humanities setting, namely information extraction via rules-based named entity recognition. Because these notebooks are designed as a primer for students new to NLP and spaCy, there are many subjects left out of these notebooks, mainly machine learning and how to train custom machine learning spaCy models.\n"

By this I mean approaching the things that spaCy does and can do and then exploring how to implement that in code. I think this is necessary so that as you explore the smaller components of spaCy, such as the Lemmatizer, you will understand how it fits into the larger architecture of the spaCy framework."

    "\n",
    "A good way to begin is by exploring the question, \"What is spaCy?\" spaCy (yes, spelled with a lowercase \"s\" and uppercase \"C\" is a natural language processing framework. **Natural language processing**, or NLP, is a branch of linguistics that seeks to parse human language in a computer system. This field is generally referred to as computational linguistics, though it has far reaching applications beyond academic linguistic research.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is used in every sector of industry, from academics who leverage it to aid in research to financial analysts who try and predict the stock market. Lawyers use NLP to help analyze thousands of legal documents in seconds to target their research and medical doctors use it to parse patient charts. NLP has been around for decades, but with the increased promise of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, that NLP rapidly expanded. This is because, as we shall learn all too well throughout this book, language is inherently ambiguous. By this, I mean that language does not always make perfect sense. In some cases, it is entirely illogical. The double-negative in English is a good example of this. In some contexts, it can be an emphatic positive, as in, \"I cannot stress this enough, I do not like pasta.\" This is, of course a lie. I love pasta, but you get my point. In other cases, the double negative can be an emphatic negative, as in, \"I ain't not doing that!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, especially native speakers of a language, we can parse these complex illogical statements with ease, especially with enough context. For computers, this is not always easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NLP is such a complex problem for computers, it requires a complex solution. The answer has been found in artificial neural networks, or ANNs or neural nets for short. These are the primary areas of research for deep learning practitioners. As the field of deep learning (and machine learning in general) expand and advance, so too does NLP. New methods for training, such as transformer models, push the field further."

Input your device settings, e.g. Mac or Windows or Linux, and your language, e.g. English, French, or German. The web-app will automatically populate the commands that you need to execute to get started. Since this is a JupyterBook, we can install these with a \"!\" before in a cell to indicate that we want to run a terminal command.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations, and some minor possessions.[j] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area.[d] The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, as well as limited maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia.[22] With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Disputes over taxation and political representation with Great Britain led to the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), which established independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition. The Spanishâ€“American War and World War I established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the Cold War, the United States fought the Korean War and the Vietnam War but avoided direct military conflict with the Soviet Union. The two superpowers competed in the Space Race, culminating in the 1969 spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Considered a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. The country ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human rights, and has low levels of perceived corruption. However, the country has received criticism concerning inequality related to race, wealth and income, the use of capital punishment, high incarceration rates, and lack of universal health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States is a highly developed country, accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP, and is the world's largest economy. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods. Although its population is only 4.2% of the world's total, it holds 29.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. Making up more than a third of global military spending, it is the foremost military power in the world; and it is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[23]\n"

You should notice that the open and close parentheses are also considered an item in the container. These are all known as tokens. **Tokens** are a fundamental building block of spaCy or any NLP framework. They can be words or punctuation marks. Tokens are something that has syntactic purpose in a sentence and is self-contained. A good example of this is the contraction \"don't\" in English. When tokenized, or the process of converting the text into tokens, we will have two tokens. \"do\" and \"n't\" because the contraction represents two words, \"do\" and \"not\".\n",
